## Rules of the Game
- The main objective of the game is to keep your job. This is done by keeping your wage above €0. 
To increase your wage you must complete orders.

- This is done by catching pizza and beer as they fall down the screen until the player's pizzas caught match the order pizzas and the player's beers caught match the order beers.

- When an order is completed, a table will appear on the side of the screen. The player must then navigate Wally The Waiter to collide with the table. 

- If Wally reaches the table, then the player’s wage will be increased by €20. 

- However, if another pizza or beer lands on Wally The Waiter before he reaches the table, Wally The Waiter will fall and the player’s wage will be reduced by €10. The player's pizzas and beers caught for the current order will be set back to 0.

- If Wally The Waiter slips on spillage, Wally The Waiter will fall and the player’s wage will be reduced by €10.
Each level has a tagline day. For example, level 1 is called “Quiet January Afternoon”. In contrast level 11 is called “St Stephens Day”. 

- The taglines help the players identify with the difficultly of the current level they are at within the game.
For each order completed, the level will increase. 

- The order size increases at each level and the speed at which pizzas and beers fall increases.
The wage starts at a flat rate of €50 at level 1. If the wage reaches €0 then the player will be sacked, and the game will be over.

- The wage from the previous level is carried over to the next level.

- The game is on a timer that lasts for 3 minutes. The game will end when the countdown hits 0 or if the player wage reaches €0.

- The highest score is measured by the highest wage at the end of the game.
